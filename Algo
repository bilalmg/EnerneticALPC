1. Assess Surplus Energy
•	Input: Real-time energy production and consumption data from the prosumer.
•	Process:
1.	Retrieve the prosumer's total energy production (EP) and total consumption (EC) data.
2.	Calculate surplus energy:
Surplus Energy=EP−EC
3.	If Surplus > 0, proceed to step 2; otherwise, end the process.
2. Inform Prosumer
•	Input: Surplus energy data.
•	Process:
1.	Notify the prosumer of the detected surplus energy via the platform's dashboard and/or mobile app.
2.	Present the option to list the surplus energy on the platform.
3. Prosumer Authorization & Pricing
•	Input: Prosumer’s authorization, price, and contract time period.
•	Process:
1.	Await prosumer's authorization to sell the surplus energy.
2.	If authorized, prompt the prosumer to set a price per kWh and select a contract time period (1, 2, 3, or 6 months).
3.	Store the authorization, price, and time period in the platform's database.
4. Listing Surplus Energy
•	Input: Authorized surplus energy details.
•	Process:
1.	Create a listing on the platform with the surplus energy amount, price, and contract time period.
2.	Make the listing visible to potential consumers.




5. Consumer Selection & Purchase
•	Input: Consumer browsing the platform.
•	Process:
1.	Display available surplus energy listings to the consumer.
2.	Allow the consumer to select a listing, choose the contract time period, and confirm the purchase.
3.	Deduct the consumer’s payment for the first month from their linked account.
4.	Store the transaction details (consumer, prosumer, energy amount, price, contract time) in the database.
6. Energy Delivery via KE Grid
•	Input: Completed transaction details.
•	Process:
1.	Notify KE of the transaction and instruct them to relay the specified amount of energy from the prosumer’s surplus to the consumer.
2.	Monitor the energy delivery and ensure compliance with the agreed-upon contract terms.
7. Post-Transaction
•	Input: Monthly billing cycle.
•	Process:
1.	At the beginning of each subsequent month, deduct the payment for that month from the consumer's account.
2.	Credit the prosumer’s account with the payment minus any platform fees.
3.	Continue energy delivery as per the contract until the time period ends.
8. Contract Completion
•	Input: Contract end date.
•	Process:
1.	On the final day of the contract, notify both the prosumer and consumer of the contract completion.
2.	Remove the energy listing from the platform.
3.	Optionally prompt the prosumer to create a new listing if additional surplus energy is available.
